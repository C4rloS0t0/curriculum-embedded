==== LG 5-1: Understand foundations of variant management

Participants can:

* Model variability, e.g. using FODA (feature-oriented domain analysis)

* Describe different mechanisms for implementing variability as well as their strengths and weaknesses:

** Aggregation/delegation

** Inheritance

** Parameterisation

** Selecting alternative building blocks

** Conditional compilation

** Aspect-oriented programming

** Generation

* Select mechanisms for implementing variability for a concrete system and reasonably justify their decision

Participants understand:

* Mechanisms for implementing variability take effect at different times, e.g. compile time vs run time.

Participants know:

* Tools for variant management
